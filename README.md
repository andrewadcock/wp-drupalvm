### Basic Settings
Ubuntu 16.04


### Special Notes
By default we are installing the following
* XDebug
* wp-cli


Sometimes when running vagrant up the first time, nginx points to 
`/var/www/html` instead of `/var/www/wp-drupalvm`. Most often, 
running `vagrant reload --provision` will correct this.
If that doesn't work you may need to edit 
`/etc/nginx/sites-available/default` to set the root to 
`/var/www/wp-drupalvm/public`. This is around line 41. Still trying to figure this one out.

```
server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        listen [::]:80 default_server;

        # SSL configuration
        #
        # listen 443 ssl default_server;
        # listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
        #
        # Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
        #
        # Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
        # See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782
        #
        # Self signed certs generated by the ssl-cert package
        # Don't use them in a production server!
        #
        # include snippets/snakeoil.conf;

        root /var/www/wp-drupalvm/public;

```


### ToDo's
